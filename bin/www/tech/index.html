            Pokémon GO has a file called the GAME_MASTER that contains statistics regarding just about everything in the game.
            <br>This file is updated on a semi-regular basis.

              To do battling, Pokémon use Moves (or "Attacks").
              These moves come in two types:
            </p>
        <ul class="CHILD">
          <li>
                "<a href="GAME_MASTER/moves/moves.fast.html"><b>Fast</b></a>": The Moves performed by tapping on the screen during battle.
              </li>
          <li>
                "<a href="GAME_MASTER/moves/moves.charged.html"><b>Charged</b></a>": The Moves performed by tapping the button at the bottom of the screen during battle.
              </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="NOTE"><b>NOTE</b>: If you find you want to change the Move Set one of your Pokemons have, you can make use of "TMs" that can be one of the rewards you get from defeating a Raid Boss.

          Want to know how to figure out the DPS for a Pokémon's Move Set?
          <br>This page goes into detail of describing the formulas used to figure that out.

    <p>
          When calculating how much damage a Pokémon will do, Pokémon GO takes into account the Level of the Pokémon.
          It does this by multiplying the Pokémon's BaseAttack and Attack IV by a constant corresponding to the Pokémon's level.
          <br>This page lists the CPM values.
