    <h1>GAME_MASTER</h1>
    <p>
      There is a file called the GAME_MASTER that contains statistics regarding just about everything in the game.
      <br />
        This file is updated on a semi-regular basis on the Niantic servers and Pokémon GO downloads it.
        </p>
    <p>
      I have collected as many historical GAME_MASTER files as I could find.
      Then I used the data in them to generate these pages.

      You can find my list at <a href="GAME_MASTER/archive/">GAME_MASTER Archive</a></p>

        Each Pokémon has a bunch of statistics associated with them. Candies, Types, Gender Ratios, and a whole lot more.
        <br />I have created a chart for each generation of Pokémon:

        To do battling, Pokémon use Moves (or "Attacks").
        These moves come in two types:
