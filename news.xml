        First of all, sorry for the down time.
        I have been running this site on a free hosting service, but found out that it had a traffic limit, which was exceeded on 17 Feb.
        I tried to upgrade, but there was miscommunication between the vendor and the company they use for handling transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 4 days of complaining, they cancelled my order this morning.
        <span class="NOTE">(Not because of my complaining, but because the transaction company didn't sync with them.)</span>
        <br />So, I redid the order, complained to everybody and they pushed it through in less than an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        It feels great to <b>
          <u>
            <i>finally</i>
          </u>
        </b> be back up!
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <b style="margin-left:25px;">AND...</b>
      <br />
      <p>
        Swablu can now show up as a Tier 1 Raid Boss so I have added it to the Raid Bosses chart.
      </p>

        During the upcoming Community Event, if you evolve a Dragonair into a Dragonite, it will have the charged move "Draco Meteor".
        As such, I have added that to the Move Sets page to allow you to see its DPS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, you may see some enhancements here and there. ;)
