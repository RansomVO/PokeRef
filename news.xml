        On 3 April 2018, the Raid Bosses changed again.
        Several from legacy came back in, but a bunch more were introduced!

      Several Things Again!

    <Text>
      <p>
        <b>Mew!</b>
        <br />
        First of all, with the new Research features, there is the ability to catch Mew!
        Not only that, TONS of Move Sets for Mew were added to the GAME_MASTER file.
        <br />The charts have been updated to show this.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="/charts/pokequick.html">
            Pokemon Quick List<span class="NOTE TODO"> (Beta)</span>
          </a>
        </b>
        <br />
        Also, with the Research features, you may get tasks that require you to catch a number of Pokemon of a certain type, etc.
        As such, I have created a Pokemon Quick List in the Charts section that is similar to the Pokemon Chart pages, but has been greatly simplified so it will be smaller and faster on mobile devices.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="charts/raidboss/raidboss.latias.html">Latias</a> and <a href="charts/raidboss/raidboss.latios.html">Latios</a>
        </b>
        <br />
        And Latias and have been relased as Raid Bosses.
        <br />The <a href="charts/raidboss">Raid Bosses</a> chart has been updated appropriately.
