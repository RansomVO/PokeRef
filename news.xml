      <p>
        Over the last month, I have been pretty hammered at work.
        Additionally, I have been working on code that will make updates (especially new Raid Bosses) be much faster and less effort.
      </p>
      <p class="parent">
        That being said, there are a lot of changes I have included with the latest release, including:
      </p>
      <ol class="INDENT CHILD">
        <li>
          New <a href="charts/raidboss/">Raid Boss</a> charts for the latest round of Raid Bosses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Updated <a href="tools/shoppingboxes.html">Shopping Boxes</a> for the Fighting-Type Pokémon Event.
        </li>
        <li>
          A new look in the <a href="tech/GAME_MASTER/pokestats/">Pokemon Stats</a> pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to see different "forms".
          <br /><span class="NOTE">
            (<b>For Example:</b> Normal, Rainy, Snowy and Sunny forms of Castform)
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          And a whole lot more!
          <br /><span class="NOTE">(And I am working a bunch of stuff you'll see soon!)</span>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I'm not completely done yet, but I wanted to get the latest to you as soon as possible, so please be patient if you find issues, but let me know.
        <div class="NOTE">
          I would <span class="EMPHASIS">

          <br />
          <div class="INDENT">
            Let me know about typos, broken links, hard-to-understand (or badly worded) information, etc.
            <br />Also, let me know if there is something you would like for me to add or enhance.

          <br />
