            There are a number of web sites out there that are geared for Pokemon GO trainers.
            <br />
            They are quite varied.
            Some are very basic. Some are extremely technical. And there are a bunch in between.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section provides links to the sites I value most.

    <div id="ANDROID_TOOLS" class="INDENT">
        <p>
            There are a number of tools available for use while playing Pokemon GO.
            <br />Here are some I use.
        </p>
        <p class="NOTE">
            <b>NOTE</b>: Some tools violate the Pokemon GO terms and using them is a good way to get yourself banned.
            These include tools for spoofing your location, or tools that log in as you to access your account.
            <br />I am totally against using any tools of that nature.
            <br />As far as I know, the ones listed here do not violate the terms.
        </p>
        <h3 id="GOIV">GoIV <button id="GOIV_TOOL_COLLAPSER" /></h3>
        <div id="GOIV_TOOL" class="INDENT" style="max-width:600px;">
            <p>
                GoIV is a tool for determining the IV score of your Pokemon.
                <br />The thing I like most about it is that it does screen scraping to get what it needs.
                Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <img class="FLOAT_LEFT IMAGE_HALF_WIDTH" src="/images/GoIV-Start.png" />
            <p>
                Go to your box, and select your Pokemon.
                Then, a button shows up on your screen.
            </p>
            <br class="FLOAT_END" />
            <br />
            <img class="FLOAT_RIGHT IMAGE_HALF_WIDTH" src="/images/GoIV-PrelimResult.png" />
            <p>
                It then shows you the possibilities by screen-scraping CP, HP and Level.
            </p>
            <br class="FLOAT_END" />
            <br />
            <img class="FLOAT_LEFT IMAGE_HALF_WIDTH" src="/images/GoIV-Refining.png" />
            <p>
                When you select the button, it pops up a dialog to allow you to refine the results.
                <br />At that point, you select appraisal and GoIV screen-scrapes what the team leader says and fills in the boxes for you.
            </p>
            <br class="FLOAT_END" />
            <br />
            <img class="FLOAT_RIGHT IMAGE_HALF_WIDTH" src="/images/GoIV-FinalResult.png" />
            <p>
                In the end, you get a full description of what it found out.
                <div class="NOTE">
                    <b>NOTE</b>: Sometimes it can't narrow down the results to a single possibility.
                    In that case it will show you the range, and you have to ability to see a list of all of the possibilities.
                </div>
            </p>
            <br class="FLOAT_END" />
            <p>
                And you can set it to copy what it discovered to the clipboard so you can easily paste it to the name.
            </p>
            <img class="FLOAT_RIGHT IMAGE_HALF_WIDTH" src="/images/GoIV-Renamed.png" />

                One of my favorite features is that when you use the IV Calculator and it there isn't a single possible IV, you can scroll down and see how many times you have to power up to narrow down the results.
                You can also see how many Candies and how much Stardust it will take to get there.
