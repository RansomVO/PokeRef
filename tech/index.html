        Pokemon GO has a file called the GAME_MASTER that contains statistics regarding just about everything in the game.
        <br />This file is updated on a semi-regular basis.

                Each Pokemon has a bunch of statistics associated with them. Candies, Types, Gender Ratios, and a whole lot more.
                <br />I have created a chart for each generation of Pokemon.

            <p class="PARENT">
                To do battling, Pokemon use Moves (or "Attacks").
                These moves come in two types:
            </p>
            <ul class="CHILD">
                <li><b>"Fast"</b>: The Moves performed by tapping on the screen during battle.</li>
                <li><b>"Charged""</b>: The Moves performed by tap-and-holding on the screen during battle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="NOTE">
                <b>NOTE</b>: If you find you want to change the Move Set one of your Pokemons have, you can make use of "TMs" that can be one of the rewards you get from defeating a Raid Boss.
            </p>
            <p class="PARENT">
                Here are charts with the important values regarding each type:

    <h2><a href="cpm.html"><b>CP Modifiers</b></a></h2>
    <p>
        When calculating how much damage a Pokemon will do, Pokemon GO takes into account the Level of the Pokemon.
        It does this by multiplying the Pokemon's BaseAttack and Attack IV by a constant corresponding to the Pokemon's level.
        <br />This page lists the CPM values.
