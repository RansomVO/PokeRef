    <h1>GAME_MASTER</h1>
    <p>
        There is a file called the GAME_MASTER that contains statistics regarding just about everything in the game.
        <br />
        This file is updated on a semi-regular basis on the Niantic servers and Pokemon GO downloads it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have collected as many historical GAME_MASTER files as I could find.
        Then I used the data in them to generate these pages.

            Each Pokemon has a bunch of statistics associated with them. Candies, Types, Gender Ratios, and a whole lot more.
            <br />I have created a chart for each generation of Pokemon:

    <div class="INDENT">
        <p class="PARENT">
            To do battling, Pokemon use Moves (or "Attacks").
            These moves come in two types:
        </p>
        <ul class="CHILD">
            <li><b>"Fast"</b>: The Moves performed by tapping on the screen during battle.</li>
            <li><b>"Charged""</b>: The Moves performed by tap-and-holding on the screen during battle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="PARENT">
            Here are charts with the important values regarding each type:
