    <h1>Pokemon Stats</h1>
    <p class="PARENT">
        Each Pokemon has a bunch of statistics associated with them. Candies, Types, Gender Ratios, and a whole lot more.
        <br />I have created a chart containing what I consider to be the important info for each generation of Pokemon:
    </p>
    <div class="CHILD">
        <script>InsertURL('_linkslist.html')</script>
    </div>

    <br />
    <p class="NOTE PARENT">
        <b>NOTE</b>: If there is info you want to see, but it is not included in the charts, please let me know.
    </p>
    <div class="INDENT">
        <script>WriteContactInfo();</script>
    </div>

    <!-- This script is defined in /js/global.js -->
    <script>WriteFooter();</script>
