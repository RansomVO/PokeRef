    <Text>
      <p>
        With the upcoming Community Day Event, if you evolve a Pupitar into a Tyranitar, it will have the Fast Move "Smack Down".
        <br />Unfortunately, the move was just nerfed. <span class="NOTE">(Made slightly less effective overall.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="charts/movesets">Move Sets</a> have been updated to reflect this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">
        <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-size:2em;">---  Also ---</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a special Community Day Box, so the <a href="tools/shoppingboxes.html">Shopping Box Values</a> tool has been updated.
