        There was a lot of snow yesterday in the Seattle area.
        So, I took the opportunity to relax and spend the night fixing up the Evolutions Page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fixed a bug where some unreleased Pokemon were on their own line instead of where the belonged.
        <br />
        And, I added how much candy and any Special Items you may need to perform the Evolve.
        Of course, I also added the ability to filter by Special Item!
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy!.

        I'm sorry that this site has been so far behind.
        I've had a number of things absorbing all of my free time.
        <br /><span class="NOTE">(Lots going on at work, trying to sell our home, trying to find a new home, family funeral, etc.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't updated everything, but hopefully I got the major stuff.
