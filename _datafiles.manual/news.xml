        Oh! There is so much!
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, more Gen 4 Pokemon are being released.
        I will update the charts as I find out about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, Mewtwo is no longer a Raid Boss, but the Gen 4 Pokemon <a href="charts/raidboss/raidboss.giratina.altered.html">Giratina</a> will be replacing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally, there is a new Special Research Task <a href="charts/research/a_spooky_message.html">A Spooky Message</a>.
       <br /><span class="NOTE">(I will be updating it as I find out what each step is.)</span>
