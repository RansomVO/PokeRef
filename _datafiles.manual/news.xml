        It was just announced that <a href="/charts/raidboss/raidboss.ho-oh.html">Ho-oh</a> will be available as a Raid Boss until the end of the month as a finale for the Johto Festival, so I have updated the Raid Boss table.
        <br />And don't for get it may be shiny!

        Unfortunately, I have not had any spare time over the last month or so, and this site has been sadly neglected.
        But I'm back now and hopefully things are going to get done.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I have updated:
        <ul>
          <li>The latest GAME_MASTER file.</li>
          <li>Raid Bosses</li>
          <li>Move Sets for Eevees (and its eeveelutions) with the move Last Resort</li>
          <li>New Shinies</li>
          <li>Alolan Forms</li>
          <li>Release of Spinda</li>
          <li>Encounters <span class="NOTE">(including Celebi!)</span></li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have more to do, but hopefully the delays won't be so long.
