      <p>
        This morning it was announced that <a href="/charts/raidboss/raidboss.regice.html">Regice</a> will now be a Raid Boss!
        <br />I have added him to the <a href="/charts/raidboss">Raid Bosses Chart</a>.

      <p class="NOTE">
        <b>NOTE:</b> I'm not sure whether Kyogre will be gone or not, so I'm leaving him there for now.
