      I was trying to get my previous update out, and then this happened!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, I'm tired and just can't finish this tonight.
        However, I wanted you to get as much as possible up front.
        <br />I have updated the Encounters, Raid Bosses, Shopping Boxes started the Special Research, etc.
        I'll finish up everything as soon as I can and update again.
