        This event doesn't start until 2 April 2019, but they have made some <a href="/tools/shoppingboxes.html">Shopping Boxes</a> available.
        <br />Check them out!

        Also, there were a couple of minor changes to the <a href="/tech/GAME_MASTER/">GAME_MASTER</a> file.

        Here is what I've done. Hopefully it is all correct now.
        <ul>
          <li>Updated which Pokemon are now available.</li>
          <li>
            Updated the <a href="/charts/raidboss">Raid Boss</a> list.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated the <a href="/charts/research">Encounters</a> page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated the <a href="/tools/shoppingboxes.html">Shopping Boxes</a> page. <span class="NOTE">(Including the Community Day box.)</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated the Moves available for a limited time <span class="NOTE">(Usually for Community Day)</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated which Pokemon may hatch from which eggs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am jumping the gun a little on a couple of things:
        <ul>
          <li>The Defense form of Deoxys won't be available until 25 March 2019</li>
          <li>The Orign form of Giratina won't be available until 02 April 2019</li>
        </ul>
        But, since they have been announced, I have set them as available right now.
        <br /><span class="NOTE">(Sorry if that throws you for a loop.)</span>
