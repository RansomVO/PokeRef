        Here is what I've done. Hopefully it is all correct now.
        <ul>
          <li>Updated which Pokemon are now available.</li>
          <li>
            Updated the <a href="/charts/raidboss">Raid Boss</a> list.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated the <a href="/charts/research">Encounters</a> page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated the <a href="/tools/shoppingboxes.html">Shopping Boxes</a> page. <span class="NOTE">(Including the Community Day box.)</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated the Moves available for a limited time <span class="NOTE">(Usually for Community Day)</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated which Pokemon may hatch from which eggs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am jumping the gun a little on a couple of things:
        <ul>
          <li>The Defense form of Deoxys won't be available until 25 March 2019</li>
          <li>The Orign form of Giratina won't be available until 02 April 2019</li>
        </ul>
        But, since they have been announced, I have set them as available right now.
        <br /><span class="NOTE">(Sorry if that throws you for a loop.)</span>

        I'm still really busy, but I did fix a few issues.
        <br />I'll see if I can get everything up-do-date this weekend.

        I'm sorry that this site has been so far behind.
        I've had a number of things absorbing all of my free time.
        <br /><span class="NOTE">(Lots going on at work, trying to sell our home, trying to find a new home, family funeral, etc.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't updated everything, but hopefully I got the major stuff.
